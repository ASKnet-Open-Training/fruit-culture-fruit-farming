*In this case we shall propagate seedlings, of fruits from nusery beds, place them in potting bags and donate to communities for planting.*

> Note: aims, objectives, vision, importance and other narratives of this repository will be filed in detaile at a later stage.

## MOTIVATION
Here is what influenced me to start this project repository:
Basing on global research most studies suggest that the optimal amount of fruits is two or five servings per day and there seems to be no harm in eating them instead it contributes too much to the immune system health wise.

**Considering this, fruitplanting will have greate impact to the community.**  


## IMPORTANCE.     
- people who are eating more fruits as part of their diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases.        
- fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintainance of the body.  
- most fruits are naturally low in fats, sodium and calories and we know the effects of too much of sodium, fats and calories, as well as the good effects of adding vitamins, so I vote these for my global communities for good health.

## VISION
My vision is to create a community well sensitised on how fruits are propagated, planted and their importance in a healthy diet.
