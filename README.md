# fruit-culture (fruitfarming)
Fruit-culture is the systematic cultivation,propagation or rearing of fruits or fruit trees.in this case we shall propagate seedlings,of fruits from nusery beds,place them in potting bags and donate to communities for planting.aims/objectives,vission ,importance,and other narratives of these repository will be filed in the later stage.
TARGET,            before unveiling the target I have say out what influenced me to writ this repository, basing on global research most studies suggest that the optimal amount of fruits is two or five servings per day and there seems to be no harm in eating them instead it contributes too much to the immune system health wise.considering this ,it will have greate impact to the community.      IMPORTANCE.     -people who are eating more fruits as part of their diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases.        -fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintainance of the body.  -most fruits are naturally low in fats,sodium,and calories and we know the effects of too much of sodium,fats and calories,so I vote these for my global commuties for good health..
VISION:            my vision is to create a community well sensitised on how fruits are propagated,planted and their importance in the diet.
