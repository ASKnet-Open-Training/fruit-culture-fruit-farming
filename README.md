 # fruit-culture (fruitfarming)
**Fruit-culture is the systematic cultivation, propagation or rearing of fruits or fruit trees.

* In this case we shall propagate seedlings, of fruits from nusery beds, place them in potting bags and donate to communities for planting.*

> Note: aims, objectives, vision, importance and other narratives of this repository will be filed in detaile at a later stage.

 # MOTIVATION

  Here is what influenced me to start this project repository:
Basing on global research most studies suggest that the optimal amount of fruits is two or five servings per day and there seems to be no harm in eating them instead it contributes too much to the immune system health wise.

** Considering this, fruitplanting will have greate impact to the community.**  


 # IMPORTANCE.     

 -  people who are eating more fruits as part of their diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases.        

 -  fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintainance of the body.  

 -  most fruits are naturally low in fats, sodium and calories and we know the effects of too much of sodium, fats and calories, as well as the good effects of adding vitamins, so I vote these for my global communities for good health.

 # VISION
 My vision is to create a community well sensitised on how fruits are propagated, planted and their importance in a healthy diet.

# Collection
 healthiest fruits on earth

 -  grape fruits 

 -  pineaples

 -  avocado

 -  blue berries

 -  apples

 -  mangoes

 -  strawberries

 -  cranberries

 -  jackfruits

 -  orange 
etc.

  Project "fruitplanting Adjumani Uganda"
Among the fruits we have potted:

 -  mangoes 

 -  orange 

 -  avocado and jackfruits, 
 we look forward to acquire more.

# FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ESTABLISHING 
ANUSERY BED.
  
  - size of land
  
  - location of land 
 
  - availability of water 
  
  - skilled labour force
 
  - availability of market
  
  - accessibility of the area.


    
  
    # TIPS,
   
The following are tips on how to plant jack fruits.
 
  - clearing the area meant for planting 
  
  - sort out the seeds you want for planting 
  
  - open up asoil depth of 2cm where you are to put your seeds 
  
  - pre treat your seeds with warm water for 30minutes before planting 
  
  - sow your seeds and gently cover with the soil 
 
  - water to provide moisture and in 6weeks the seeds shall have germinated into healthy seedling.
   
   # SOIL TYPE.
  
  - sandy loam that is granular and porous 
  
  - the soil should enable water and air movement.
  
  - the soil pH should be around 6.0 to 7.5.
  
  - it should be slightly acidic.


 # MATERIALS;
 
 The following are materials needed setting anurserybed shed;
  
 - plow. 
 
 - hoe.
 
 - rented draft animal or hand tractor.
 
 - shovels.
  
 - budding knife.
 
 - pruning shears.
 
 - pruning saw.
  
 - pohs(plastic bags,bamboo, clay).
  
 - plastic sheets.
  
 - spade.
  
 - wood or wire.
  
 - fencing construction materials.
  
 - watering cans.

 - hose soil,sand and compost.


    # PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL;
  
  - soil texture,which is referred to as the relative proportion of particles of various sizes such as sand,silt and clay in the soil.  -
 
  - soil structur
  
  - consistenc 
  
  - partiole densit
  
  - bulky density.
  
  - porespaces.
 
  - soil colour

  - atterberg limits(basic measure of critical water contents of fine grained soil,ie
 
  . it's shrinkage limit
  . it's plastic limit
  . liquid limits depending on its water content
 
  
  - Asoil may appear in one or four states,; solid,semisolid, plastic and liquid.




# CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL;
   
  - cation exchange capacity.
  
  - soil pH.
   
  - base saturation percentage.
  
  - plant nutrients.
  
  - organic soil carbon.
  
  - soil nitrogen.
  
  - soil salinity.
  
  - soil sodicity.                          
  
  - It's defined as the negative logarithm of activity of hydronium ions in the solution..
  
  - pH falls between 3 and 10 with 7 being neutral.
  
  - The required pH for fruit farming is from 6-7.5.


# SOME SCIENTIFIC NAMES OF CERTAIN FRUITS.

- mango - Mangifera indica

- Apple - pyrus malus
